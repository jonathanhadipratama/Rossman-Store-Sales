## Objective
Sales is such an important thing for the store. Through deep analysis in sales, the store’s
owner can evaluate the past sales and learn from it. Moreover, using regressor model to
predict future sales, the owner can set the strategy to face the future.

## Method
for data preparation and data cleansing, mostly I process it in MySQL. Technically, it’s not
necessary using MySQL to process this data set since the data isn’t too big and only
consists of two tables. But my purpose in using MySQL is to deepen my skill because SQL
is a powerful tool for data science.
for sales prediction, I decompose the date-time data and use it as a parameter to predict
the future sales using regressor model
